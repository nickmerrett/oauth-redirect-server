# MURAL OAuth 2.0 Simple Sample

Sample Node.js web app going through MURAL's OAuth 2.0 procedure.

The MURAL docs have an excellent explanation: [MURAL API (BETA) Authentication](https://developers.mural.co/public/docs/oauth)

And the MURAL team has built their own demo OAuth app: [MURAL OAuth2 Server](https://github.com/muralco/api-oauth)

But if this happens to be the first time you've worked through OAuth 2.0, you can download the simpler app here, walk through the code, copy and update it for your use, and learn in the process.  This simpler app doesn't get into refreshing tokens, it focuses only on getting through the authorization redirects to get a token.
